This is a rough collection of sketches I have made for various projects. They are here both as a record for myself as I work on multiple computers and as "working" examples to help others.

The code should all be working (at least it was when I submitted it). I mostly develop on the esp8266 or esp32. I will try to add comments to the head of the inos with a statement of general intent.
